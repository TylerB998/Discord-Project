# myDiscordProject
This is my discord bot using the characters from the anime show Overlord. This bot provides information on the show, its lore, and its characters. By using 
/Ainz or /Albedo the user will be given information on these characters and provided a Wikipedia link to the character if the user wants to take a deeper dive into the
character.

This bot also has useful tools that the users can access to assist them with their daily lives, for example, the user can type /schedule and setup a specific time + date
to be reminded of an event. The bot will ping the user to alert them of their event at their desired time. 

However, in order to setup the bot on your own server, it'll require you to setup your own MogoDB cloud database.
